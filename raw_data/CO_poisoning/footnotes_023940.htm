													<li><p>The hospital data shown here are provided by state and/or local public health departments to the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program.</p></li>
													<li><p>Data are based on the date of admission rather than the date of discharge.</p></li>
													<li><p>Hospital admission records are selected using primary and other diagnosis codes.</p></li>
													<li><p>These data represent number of admissions rather than number of individuals admitted to the hospital. For example, a person admitted twice in one year would count as two admissions.</p></li>
													<li><p>Data from Veterans Affairs, Indian Health Services and institutionalized (e.g., prison) populations are not included in the dataset submitted to National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program.</p></li>
													<li><p>Data for transfers of a single episode between hospitals have not been excluded.</p></li>
													<li><p>Admissions of residents to out-of-state hospitals are excluded for most states. Admissions for border counties may be under estimated. The inclusion of these admissions by some states can affect state to state comparability.</p></li>
													<li><p>Rates were age-adjusted by the direct method using 2000 US standard population. </p></li>
													<li>On October 1, 2015 in the US, ICD-10-CM replaced ICD-9-CM for coding of medical terminology and disease classification. This coding change impacts information classifications for hospital discharge, emergency department, and outpatient records for administrative and financial transactions in all healthcare settings. In 2015, data were coded as ICD-9-CM from January to September and as ICD-10-CM from October to December in 2015. Differences in counts and rates in years prior to 2015 (ICD-9-CM) compared with 2015 (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) and subsequent years (ICD-10-CM) could be a result of this coding change and not an actual difference in the number of events.</li>
													<li><p>Differences in the data between states or counties or over time may be due to the differences in coding, diagnostic techniques, and hospital admission practices.</p></li>
													<li><p>CDC Tracking Network suppresses data for counties with non-zero counts less than 6 and population less than 100,000 to protect confidentiality.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><p>The use and quality of ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM coding varies across jurisdictions; this is especially true of the codes used to describe how an injury occurs, indicated as E-codes. Examples of this variation include:</p><ul><li>The number of diagnostic fields available to specify cause of the injury;</li><li>Whether E-codes are mandated;</li><li>The completeness and quality of E-coding; for example, the reliability of ICD-9-CM coding to distinguish between cases of CO poisoning that are intentional or unintentional, and/or fire-or non-fire related</li></ul><p>The toxic effects of CO exposure are nonspecific and easily misdiagnosed when CO exposure is not suspected. These misdiagnosed cases will not be counted.</p><p>These data usually do not include data from federal facilities such as Veteran&#39;s Administration hospitals, Indian Health Services, or institutionalized populations (e.g., prisons).</p><p>These data usually include only cases of state residents treated within the state. Health-care access is not restricted to these political boundaries so patients hospitalized for CO poisoning in another state may not be counted in their own state. Likewise, they may not be counted in the jurisdiction in which they were treated. Currently, few states have access to, or agreements to obtain, hospital discharge data from other states where their state residents may be hospitalized. To the extent that patients are treated out of state, there is undercounting of the rate of state residents poisoned by CO.</p><p>Differences in rates between jurisdictions may reflect differences in hospital admissions practices for treating persons with severe CO poisoning. For example, some facilities may routinely admit all patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen; other facilities may release patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen after the treatment is completed if they are in stable condition.</p><p>Race and ethnicity are important risk factors for CO poisoning, yet, many hospitalization data sets do not contain these data. Those that do may have data quality issues.</p></p>

				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>On October 1, 2015 in the United States, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) replaced the ninth revision (ICD-9-CM) for coding of medical terminology and disease classification. As a direct result of this change, there are nearly five times as many diagnosis codes in ICD-10-CM than in ICD-9-CM, allowing further expansion than was possible with ICD-9-CM. This coding change impacts information classifications for hospital discharge, emergency department, and outpatient records for administrative and financial transactions in all healthcare settings. Differences in counts and rates in years prior to 2015 (ICD-9-CM) compared with 2015 (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) and subsequent years (ICD-10-CM) could be a result of this coding change and not an actual difference in the number of events.</p><p>Hospitalization data, by definition, do not include: persons treated in outpatient settings (e.g., emergency departments, urgent care clinics, clinicians&#39; offices or hyperbaric chambers but not hospitalized); persons who call poison control centers and are managed at the scene, and/or receive medical care but are not hospitalized; persons who do not seek any medical care; or persons who die immediately from CO exposure without medical care.</p></p>
