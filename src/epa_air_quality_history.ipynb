    "This is the supporting notebook to get the actual AQI data for Alexandria from 1964-2021. This notebook uses the EPA AQS API to get data for any city using the county or bounding box. For Alexandria I went with the bounding box approach with a 50 miles radius as Alexandria is an independent city without any county associated with it. The code will generate a final csv file with mean annual AQI values which we get from the monitoring stations.\n",

    "### Step 4: Making a daily summary request\n",
    "The following code encapsulates requests to the EPA AQS API through the request_daily_summary function, streamlining the process of retrieving daily air quality summary data for specific sensors over a specified date range. Users are advised to start by creating or copying a parameter template, initializing it with static values, and then updating dynamic parameters like date ranges for each call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The request_daily_summary function is highly flexible, accepting parameters such as email_address, key, param, begin_date, end_date, and an optional FIPS code. When provided, these parameters override any preset values in the template, ensuring customizable and accurate requests. Essential parameters, including email, key, parameter values, and date range, are checked to prevent errors, ensuring the request can be processed successfully. After constructing the request URL with the API’s base URL and action endpoint, the function enforces a throttle delay to respect rate limits before making the GET request. The response is then parsed as JSON, with errors handled gracefully by printing any encountered issues and returning None if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is optimized for querying the AQS API for historical daily summaries, covering data from 1964 to 2024. Additionally, it applies a filter to retrieve data only for \"Wildfire Season\" (May to October each year)."
